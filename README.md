# Melusine + Arta's Workshop

In this workshop, you will discover two of MAIF’s open source projects and learn how to use them.

First, you will work with [Melusine](https://maif.github.io/melusine/) and build a processing pipeline from scratch to extract insights from emails.
Then, you will use [Arta](https://maif.github.io/arta/) and business rules to refine them into actionable business data.
